  VeeJay.tv was created by two music fans that also spend a lot of time on the interwebs.
  Jon and Drew met at a previous startup in San Francisco, and joined forces again at Mashup Camp 2008.
  Veejay.tv was one of Jon's many project ideas, and Jon and Drew decided to work on it during Mashup Camp.
  They bought the domain on Monday, and immediately got to work designing and building out the site.
  After two sleep-deprived nights, they demo'd the site on Wednesday at Mashup Camp.

<p>
  This is technically a side project, but it takes up most of their time.
  They plan to continue their work on the service, and are already working on some cool new features - check back often to see what's been added.
